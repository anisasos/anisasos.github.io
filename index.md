I am a computer science major at csuf and I plan on graduating in 2029.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

*Lab 1

This one of my favorites because it was introducing the course. It taught us how github works and how to format code. It was also the very first coding lesson I’ve had after many years.

*Lab 3

Lab 3 was also a favorites because it taught us how to use functions in order to figure out the BMR for men and women. I also learned how to debug code and format output.

*Lab 4

This was one of my favorite labs because it found the high-low game very interesting. It was like implementing guesses and running them through a system to see if it was correct or too low/high.
